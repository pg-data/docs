## Introduction:
In the U.S., energy generation and usage is monitored and controlled by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission *(FERC)*. FERC has regional subsidiaries known as Independent System Operators *(ISO)* or Regional Transmission Organization *(RTO)*. These ISOs and RTOs have recently started providing their data and statistics in real time located on their respective website to help provide energy information to the public in an attempt to find new ways to innovate and create value-added services.

Several of these ISO/RTOs have constructed an Application Programming Interface *(API)* that allows this data to be collected via use of computer software without human intervention. This, theoretically, will make it feasible to automate the collection of data from one or multiple data sources. This data can consist of anything from power consumption, power generation, renewable energy production, and much more.

## Purpose:
The purpose of ***PGData*** is to collect this information from available ISOs and RTOs and collectively display it in one central location for educational use within the UA Little Rock Systems Engineering Department (SYEN). Currently the data available differs in terms of format and value from one source to another. This has proven to be a challenging method of aiding in the educational value as the time it takes to sort, explain, or even recalculate the data to assist in lectures or demonstrations is often considered wasteful or inefficient. By collecting this data and manipulating the information in such a way that it is consistent from source to source, it can be provided in a central location with an easy to use interface that will be intuitive and educational.
